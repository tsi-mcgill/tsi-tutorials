# Data Project

My research is very interesting, and the wider community is very interested in my data. For this reason, I have made a lot of my data publically available.

Here is an example of the data available within a table:

<!-- Use figure to centre -->
<figure markdown>
| Index       | Value1  | Value2 |
| ----------- | ------- | ----|
| 78 | 0.95110127 | 1.04049818 |  
| 65 | -0.52254243 | 0.29026636 |  
| 49 | 0.55930288 | 0.53497085 |  
| 47 | -0.15204086 | -1.14562503 |  
| 65 | -1.07484408 | 0.74457319 |  
| 39 | -0.78643181 | 1.52530604 |
